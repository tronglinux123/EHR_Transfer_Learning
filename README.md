# EHR Transfer Learning for Chronic Respiratory Disease Diagnosis

This repository presents a machine learning framework for Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD) diagnosis by integrating chest X-ray (CXR) features with Electronic Health Records (EHR).
The work focuses on transfer learning and multimodal learning under severe class imbalance settings.

## Overview

Transfer learning with DenseNet for chest X-ray feature extraction

Multimodal learning combining CXR features and structured EHR data

Emphasis on class imbalance handling for rare respiratory diseases

Evaluation on multiple CRD prediction tasks

## Data Sources and Access Notice

This project relies on the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets, which contain a wide range of clinical records and chest X-ray images collected from intensive care unit patients.

⚠️ Important Notice on Data Access

The datasets used in this project are not publicly downloadable.

Access to MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR requires:

Completion of the official PhysioNet credentialed health [data training](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/view-required-training/2.2/#1)

An approved PhysioNet account

Users must comply with all data use agreements and ethical guidelines defined by PhysioNet.

## Data Augmentation

### Model 1 – SMOTE + XGBoost  
**Contributor:** Trần Thành Trọng  
- SMOTE on image features  
- XGBClassifier / XGBRegressor for EHR reconstruction  

### Model 2 – ROS + XGBClassifier  
**Contributor:** Bùi Đăng Khoa
- Random Over-Sampling on training set only  
- Evaluated with:
  - Image features only
  - Image + EHR features  

---

## Results (Key Findings)
- Image-only models suffer from severe class imbalance
- SMOTE combined with XGBClassifier/XGBRegressor helps rare diseases overcome near-zero Recall, while simultaneously optimizing the F1-score and enhancing disease detection capability.
- ROS + XGBClassifier combined with EHR features demonstrates a favorable Precision–Recall trade-off.
- EHR features significantly improve detection of rare CRDs

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
